Overall Summary
This contract contains a mix of standard and concerning clauses. The primary concerns involve the lack of a Statement of Work attachment and the automatic renewal clause. Addressing these issues will significantly improve the fairness and enforceability of the agreement.

Scope of Services
high Risk
Service Provider agrees to provide consulting, maintenance, and technical support services as detailed in the attached Statement of Work.

Risk Analysis: The Statement of Work is not attached. This clause is therefore incomplete and unenforceable.

Suggestion: Attach the Statement of Work to this agreement and clearly reference it in this clause.

Payment Terms
low Risk
The Client agrees to pay the Service Provider a monthly fee of $5000 for services rendered, payable within 15 days of receiving the invoice.

Renewal and Adjustment
medium Risk

Suggestion: Consider modifying the automatic renewal clause to require annual renewals, or provide a mechanism for the Client to easily opt out of renewals.

Service Management
low Risk
