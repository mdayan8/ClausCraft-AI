Logic Behind AI-Powered Contract Analysis & Risk Detection
Step 1: Extract Text from Contracts (PDF/Text Processing)
Tools Used: PDFPlumber, PyMuPDF, Tesseract OCR
Logic:
If the document is a searchable PDF, extract text directly using PyMuPDF or PDFPlumber.
If the document is scanned (image-based PDF), use Tesseract OCR to convert the image into readable text.
Preprocessing: Remove extra whitespaces, line breaks, and special characters to clean the text for analysis.
Step 2: Process Text Using Open-Source LLM (Mistral/Gemma)
Logic:
Pass the cleaned text to an NLP pipeline using Mistral/Gemma (Hugging Face).
Use a legal-specific prompt to detect and classify clauses.
Apply Named Entity Recognition (NER) to detect contract-related terms such as "termination," "indemnity," or "confidentiality."
Break down the document into sections for clause-based analysis.
Step 3: Clause Risk Classification & Highlighting
Logic:
Predefined risk categories:
Termination Risks: Look for words like "immediate termination," "without notice," "unilateral termination."
Indemnity & Liability Issues: Identify phrases like "hold harmless," "indemnify," "unlimited liability."
Confidentiality Concerns: Detect terms like "perpetual confidentiality," "unauthorized disclosure penalties."
Unfair Penalties: Spot clauses mentioning "excessive late fees," "unjustifiable fines," or "forfeiture of rights."
The AI assigns a risk score to each clause based on severity.
Step 4: Justifications & Suggested Modifications
Logic:
For high-risk clauses, AI generates an explanation based on legal best practices.
AI suggests modifications to ensure fairness (e.g., "Replace â€˜unilateral terminationâ€™ with â€˜termination with mutual noticeâ€™").
Output structured risk highlights, displaying clauses in red (high risk), yellow (moderate risk), and green (safe).
Logic Behind AI-Powered Contract Generator
Step 1: User Selects Contract Type
Logic:
The user chooses a contract type (NDA, Freelancer Agreement, Lease Agreement, etc.).
The backend loads a template structure based on the selected type.
Step 2: AI Asks for Key Details
Logic:
AI dynamically generates a form asking for required fields (e.g., "Party Name", "Payment Terms", "Confidentiality Period").
The system ensures required fields are legally valid (e.g., a contract must have a "Governing Law" section).
Step 3: AI Generates Contract Using Predefined Template
Logic:
The AI fills in the legal template with user-provided details.
Uses Mistral/Gemma for context-aware clause completion to ensure grammatical correctness and legal coherence.
AI reviews the generated contract for redundancies or missing sections.
Step 4: User Can Edit & Download Contract
Logic:
The generated contract is formatted in Markdown (for easy styling).
The user can edit clauses before finalizing the document.
The contract is converted into a PDF using WeasyPrint or ReportLab.
